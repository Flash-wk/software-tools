# HTTP

We are now starting Part 2 of Software Tools. This term we'll be covering a
number of web technologies, and as basis for that we'll be starting by
considering the web itself, beginning with the web protocol known as HTTP. 

## Pre-reading 

Please begin by watching the videos below. After you've done that, I want you to
read parts of [RFC 7320](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230). This is a
comprehensive outline of the protocol for HTTP, but you can focus on sections
2.1, 2.2, 2.7 and 3.
